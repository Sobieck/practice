I just installed Visual Studio 2015 Professional at home and I've been programming a little in ASP.NET vNext. And I'm really loving VS2015.

CodeLens is really cool. I spend a good deal of time at work annotating files to see who last edited a method. I do lots of Resharper reference checks to see if it is safe to delete a method. It is also nice that there is indicators of test activity. So this would be a real time saver once you get used to how it changes the look of the code.

vNext is different but I think I'm liking it. I'm enjoying how lean my using statements are on controllers. It was a pain to figure out how to get unit tests to work since new C# doesn't seem to be able to reference old C#.

Everything else is pretty neat. When you debug a project performance tools show up in the right hand corner so you can see how much CPU and memory actions take (very very cool). And the amount of time each line takes flashes under th code as you debug. And I bet I've just scratched the surface.

 Programming at home in C# is a bit of a struggle without a couple third party tools. I miss Resharper a lot. I have several very useful (like add reference) shortcuts that are just hardwired into my brain. It is very frustrating to expect something to happen after you hit a command and it not happen. I also miss the immediacy of nCrunch for my unit tests. Building and running tests breaks my chain of thought.

With all that said I'm really looking forward to getting 2015 at work.
