Today I learned not to keep two completely different Websites in azure with nearly identical names. I was attempting to delete the first website I ever made with MVC, sobieck.azurewebsites.com. It was just a little app for keeping track of how much time I put into learning how to program. It was a simple little app and I just didn't have any use for it any longer.

So, this morning at 4 AM when I woke up to start programming project comparing SQL Azure with Redis I decided to just delete that old program while I was in the azure portal. But I ended up deleting Sobieck.com. My blog. Damnit.

It was a little WordPress deal. With just a single blog about Implementing the Sieve of Eratosthenes in Elixer. Oh well. I was sort of guilty about not paying more attention to it.

So, lessons learned. Blog posts will be in source control and names of websites will be very different from each other!

Also, I will start posting blogs more often.
