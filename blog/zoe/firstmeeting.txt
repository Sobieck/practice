The first time I met Zoe she was very drugged. Lisa picked her up at the humane society where Zoe had just been spayed. Lisa entered the apartment and put Zoe on the floor. Zoe walked like a drunk stumbling here and there but as soon as she saw me she started barking. She didn't like men. It was a definitely a good thing that I didn't go to the humane society to pick a dog out with Lisa because I would have never picked Zoe...
