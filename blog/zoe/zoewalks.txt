Zoe loved going for walks. Besides eating, it was the highlight of her day. She would pester me in the morning by making a cute whimpering sound until I gave in. I gave in quickly. She loved to sniff constantly along the way, except in winter when she would book it home. She didn't like it too hot or too cold. She was my little princess.
