Zoe hated squirrels. On the deck going out to her pooping place we feed birds and squirrels with seeds. Every time see saw a squirrel there she would do her damnedest to kill it. The squirrels could easily avoided her by jumping into the trees that grow right next to the deck or run down the deck pool to the yard. The deck isn't your typical short deck either, it is about 10 feet high. So one day she saw a squirrel and just stared after it and she almost got it. The problem was that the deck ended and when the dust settled she was hanging off the deck with her little back legs. She was slowly able to get back up but it like an eternity. This was terrifying for me to say the least, but it didn't seem to phase her as she kept trying to murder squirrels.

Ps. We eventually put in slats to ensure that it is impossible for sweet little doggies to fall off the deck.
