Zoe would drag her back feet and run around in a circle when excited. This happened frequently, and she loved mornings so much that she drag her feet down the stairs (a new day meant a new walk). It would make a distressing plop sound every time her back legs impacted the stairs... Her most memorable dragging experience was dragging her legs all the way down a 50 foot dune in Michigan.
