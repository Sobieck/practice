Zoe had some ear problems. She had floppy ears that would itch her sometimes. She also had pretty short legs. So, when her ears started to bother her she would lay on her back and attempt to scratch her ears with her stubby front legs. This frankly was a little sad. It didn't work all that well for her. So I would take pity on her and give her a little ear rub. The ear rub consisted of her laying on top of me and me making circles in and around her ears. She grew to love these ear rubs and for a time I would give her one every night before bedtime (I eventually stopped because it was tedious). She would become so blissed out that she would fall asleep to it.
