I love to watch Premier League matches. The team I follow is Manchester United due to the fact that they were the only team I was aware of when my friends and I decided to watch soccer. I used to holler and yell when they would score a goal which would scare the hell out of Zoe. I eventually learned that I needed to celebrate quietly so as to not scare the dog, but this still didn't help. If Zoe heard a game on the TV she would start to pace around nervously and cling to her mommy.
