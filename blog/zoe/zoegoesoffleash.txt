I used to take Zoe on walks everyday. For a long while we would go out to a nature area near my house and I would allow her to walk off leash. I would continue at my normal speed the whole time but Zoe would take her sweet time at places smelling interesting things. Then she would have to run to catch up. It was extremely funny to watch a Shih Tzu run because of her longish hair and short legs...
