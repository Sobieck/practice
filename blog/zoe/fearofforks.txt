Zoe would normally clean the dishes after dinner. She would get the plate or bowl put on the floor and then she would make sure it had nothing on in (unless it was something gross like lettuce). However, she was a skittish dog and didn’t like loud noises. So, she wouldn’t eat from a plate if it had silverware on in because at any moment it might make a loud noise. So, she would always wait patiently until the offending fork or spoon was removed so she could finish up.
