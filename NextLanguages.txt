Uncle Bob's Recommendations
Fourth
prolog

Others I'm interested in

• C++ 
• Python
• Ruby-On-Rails (A lot of jobs)
• Go 
• oCaml - Mirage
• Erlang 

I mean, once you've programmed in Assembler, FORTRAN, C, Pascal, C++, Smalltalk, Lisp, Prolog, Erlang, and Forth, you've seen it all. 
Oh, I suppose you could toss in languages like Snobol, ML, Cobol, and XSLT (retch, puke). But most of their ideas were really covered in the previous list. - Uncle Bob - http://blog.8thlight.com/uncle-bob/2015/08/06/let-the-magic-die.html
I think people should learn an assembly language as early as possible. I don't expect them to use that assembler for very long because working in assembly language is slow and painful (and joyous!). My goal in advocating that everyone learn such a language is to make sure that the magic is destroyed.
